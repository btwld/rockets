        Describe your vision for this package:
        - What would be its core functionality?
        - How would it integrate with NestJS?
        - What abstract interfaces or patterns would it implement?
        - How could it be reused across different projects?

        Consider including:
        * High-level architecture diagrams
        * Example usage code blocks
        * Similar existing solutions (and how this would differ)
